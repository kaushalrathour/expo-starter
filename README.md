  }

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Pod Install Issues (iOS)

**Problem**: `Unable to find a specification for RNWorklets depended upon by RNReanimated`

**Solution**: This template uses `react-native-reanimated@3.19.0` to prevent this issue. If you still encounter problems:

```bash
# Method 1: Update pod repos
cd ios && pod install --repo-update

# Method 2: Clean and reinstall
cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock && pod install

# Method 3: Reset pod cache
pod cache clean --all && pod install
```

**Why this happens**: Newer versions of `react-native-reanimated` depend on `RNWorklets`, but dependency resolution can fail. Our template pins to a stable version.

### Common npm Install Errors

```bash
# ❌ Wrong syntax
npm install "react-native-reanimated": "^3.19.0"

# ✅ Correct syntax  
npm install react-native-reanimated@3.19.0
```

### Metro Bundle Issues

```bash
# Reset Metro cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Clean build folders
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
cd ios && xcodebuild clean && cd ..
```
